Process Related to Instance 1:

Create two instances instance 1 and instance 2 in two different availability zones. lets say in 1a & 1b

Now Create new 5gb Volume 1 in 1a availability zone & attach it to instance 1
Now launch the instance 1 and mount the volume 1 to it,
after mounting vol1 to instance 1

( commands for mounting vol1 :
  •fdisk -l
  •mkfs -V -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
  •mount /dev/xvdf /mnt
  •cd /mnt 
  Here create A,B,C directories in this /mnt mounted directory.

Now Go To Volume option, select on action and create snapshot of volume 1. After creating Snapshot1 now again add/create directories D,E,F in vol1, Now create Snapshot of this incremented volume and give it a name Snapshot2.



Process Related To Instance 2:
Part 1

Here instance 2 is created in 1b availability zone,
So Create Volume of Snapshot2 in this availability zone 1b & give it name Vol2.
Now attach this created vol2 to instance2.
Now Mount Vol2 to Instance2.
( commands for mounting vol2 :
  •fdisk -l
  don't use format commond here
  •mount /dev/xvdf /mnt
  •cd /mnt 
  •ls -l
  Now here check whether our directories are there or not (A,B,C,D,E,F,).

Part 2

Now create Volume from Snapshot1 in 1b availability zone so that we can attach this volume to Instance2 (give name to this volume as Vol3).
Now attach this Vol3 to this Instance2.

Now While mounting this Vol3  to Instance2, our Instance 2 is running so come out of directory
/mnt by usning cd .. command


( commands for mounting Vol3 :
  •fdisk -l
  don't use format commond here
  •mount /dev/xvdg /devops
  •cd /devops
  •ls -l
